The konami_code is easy to intall :
- Create a directory to put the files where you want on the site
(the path to this directory will be called path_to_directory int the next instructions)
- Put konami.js and xwing.png in path_to_directory
- Add  this line in the head of your site :
<script src="path_to_directory/konami.js"></script>
- Modify the scriptSrc variable in this script
- If your site doesn't use jQuery, add this line to the head of your site :
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
